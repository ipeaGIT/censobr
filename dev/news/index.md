## censobr v0.5.0

CRAN release: 2025-07-07

- Major changes
  - New function
    [`get_censobr_cache_dir()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/censobr/dev/reference/get_censobr_cache_dir.md)
  - The function
    [`set_censobr_cache_dir()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/censobr/dev/reference/set_censobr_cache_dir.md)
    now sets cache directories that persist across R sessions. Closes
    [\#55](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/censobr/issues/55). The data is
    saved in versioned directory inside the cache directory.
  - The `year` parameter no longer defaults to `2010`.
  - New parameter `verbose` (logical) indicating whether functions
    should print messsages
- Minor changes
  - Improved internal code of `merge_households = TRUE` to avoid
    duplicated columns
  - Improved package info and error messages with {cli}
  - {censobr} now imports {cli} and {rlang}
- New data set and files included in this version:
  - 2022 census. Closes

  - 2000 census. Closes
    [\#43](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/censobr/issues/43)
    - Census-tract level data
  - All data sets are save in `.parquet` compressed using
    `compression='zstd'` and `compression_level = 22`. This has almost
    halved the size of data files, making downloads much more efficient
    at minimal cost of reading time.
  - All data sets are now sorted by key columns to speed up join
    operations. Closes
    [\#60](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/censobr/issues/60).
  - Fixed annoying message about arrow metadata. closed
    [\#56](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/censobr/issues/56).

    Partially closes
    [\#31](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/censobr/issues/31)
  - {censobr} now imports the {duckplyr} package, which is used for

    package now automatically detects whether the data/documentation
    file has been updated and should be downloaded again.
- Changes to data sets and files included in this version:
